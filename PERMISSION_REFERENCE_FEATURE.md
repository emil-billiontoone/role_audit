## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Understanding Test Coverage
**Before:** "What does 'Sample Rework' test?"
**Now:** Open PDF → Page 2-4 → Find "Sample Management" → Read description

### Scenario 2: Explaining to Stakeholders
**Before:** Need separate documentation to explain tests
**Now:** Share PDF → Reference section explains everything

### Scenario 3: Compliance Audits
**Before:** Provide test list + separate descriptions
**Now:** Single PDF contains complete test catalog and results

### Scenario 4: Onboarding
**Before:** New team members need external docs
**Now:** PDF serves as comprehensive reference guide

## How It Works

The PDF generator includes a built-in dictionary of all permission tests with descriptions:

```python
PERMISSION_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    "Clarity Login": "Tests ability to authenticate and access...",
    "Create Project": "Tests permission to create new projects...",
    # ... 42+ more tests
}
```

Tests are automatically organized into categories and formatted into clean tables.

## Visual Design

- **Clean tables** - Easy to scan and read
- **Category headings** - Clear organization
- **Alternating row colors** - Better readability
- **Consistent formatting** - Professional appearance
- **Proper spacing** - Not cramped or cluttered

## Automatic Generation

This section is **automatically included** in every PDF report:

```bash
# Just generate the PDF as normal
python generate_pdf_report.py

# Or run tests with automatic PDF generation
python run_all_roles.py "Emil" "Test"
```

No configuration needed - it's always there!

## Customization

To add or modify test descriptions, edit `generate_pdf_report.py`:

```python
PERMISSION_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    "Your New Test": "Description of what it does...",
    # ... existing tests
}
```

Then update the category organization:

```python
categories = {
    "Your Category": [
        "Your New Test"
    ],
    # ... existing categories
}
```
